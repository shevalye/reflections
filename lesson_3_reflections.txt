When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 when i'm sure branch is working ok to make it public, so that collaborators could pull it/work on it

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 you might want to leave branch not updated for a while or change branch to pull to or delete remote etc. when pulling manually you think about it.
